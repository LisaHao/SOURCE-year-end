    <p>Pilgrim Place is a senior community in Claremont, CA for individuals who have dedicated their lives to missionary, charity or nonprofit work. As impactful and important as this line of work may be, many find it difficult to comfortably retire after dedicating their lives to service— which is where Pilgrim Place bridges the gap. Overall, it draws many parallels to the Claremont Colleges: it is a hub where intellectuals with diverse experiences live together in a socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner. Residents commit their time to volunteering, serving the community, and pursuing their passions.</p>
    <p>A key aspect to Pilgrim Place’s residential service is that all residents are ensured housing and healthcare, even if they are no longer able to afford such services. The funds to support such residents are from Residents’ Health and Support Program (RHSP), which fundraises from both direct donations and the Pilgrim Place Festival. Every November since 1949, Pilgrim Place has had Festival: a weekend-long, free, public event drawing in over 5,000 visitors from around the country. There are train rides for children, food booths selling baked goods, and art stands that sell everything from resident-made paintings to antique artworks collected worldwide through missionary travels. All in all, there are over 40 different booths spread throughout the Pilgrim Place neighborhood, and all profits are deposited directly into RHSP.</p>
    <p>When Pilgrim Place’s Strategic Visioning Committee (SVC) approached SOURCE with the aim to increase channels of revenue for their organization, we were excited to see what options we could pursue to achieve this goal. The need for new channels of revenue came amidst another  increase in annual fees for Pilgrim Place residents, which have been steadily rising year to year. The higher the fees, the higher the financial burden on the community, which Pilgrim Place’s administration is trying to avoid. Whilst conventional methods for fundraising such as grant writing and donor outreach were on the table, my team and I aspired to try something more novel and unique to the organization. Having access to a plethora of talented artists was a rare opportunity that we decided to hone in on. We determined that expanding the capacity of Festival to an online platform through Etsy would allow the resident made art pieces to gain exposure to millions of new potential buyers (Etsy has over 28 million users), whilst allowing more targeted searches of specific art types and pieces (niche forms of art sometimes do not sell as well to the smaller audience at Festival). After many talks with the residents, both the SVC and our team concluded that the profits from the store would be most impactful when used in RHSP to increase the buffer for the residents who were most in need.</p>
    <p>The most exciting aspect of this project was how client-tailored each step was. Through the processes of conducting initial market research, determining shipping material suppliers, and creating operational procedures, my team and I constantly had Pilgrim Place’s overall agenda and focus in mind. Taking a step back at times to see the entirety of the project and just how it would fit into the large-scale picture of helping improve Pilgrim Place was a critical skill we all learned through the process. The level of client-specific customization certainly paid off, for we launched the store as scheduled and have already turned a profit within 2 months of launch.</p>
    <p>Our year-long journey with Pilgrim Place has been an adventure that certainly challenged our skills in many ways, allowing everyone to grow as we took on roles that we were both comfortable with and had never tried before. I look forward to working with Pilgrim Place this upcoming year as they return as a rollover client.</p>
