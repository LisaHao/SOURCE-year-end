    <p>I dragged the last text box into place before pushing back my chair away from the computer desk. After scrolling through the finished product, I turned to Rachel and smiled. I knew this was a turning point in my SOURCE experience.</p>
    <p>I have never had much trouble speaking up when I knew I had something to offer. Going to Claremont McKenna College and working in SOURCE, I knew I was in good company. Surrounded by a diverse consultant class of leaders ready to get involved and share, I knew SOURCE would never have a shortage of expertise.</p>
    <p>This was undoubtedly comforting; I knew I was a part of a strong organization with wide-reaching capabilities. But I soon found that it can be intimidating too. It’s nerve-racking to offer your opinions or participation when you are not the most qualified. I fell into the trap of only leading when I knew and watching when I did not. We had work to get done and nonprofits to help. Who was I to ask another consultant to stop and teach me when it was not one of those explicit “teaching moments”?</p>
    <p>I should have known that this feeling would not last long in SOURCE. Around every corner, I was offered opportunities to lead. I grew tremendously, but I still lacked the confidence to step up and be involved as a means to learn, not just lead.</p>
    <p>That is when Rachel’s Task Force started. In SOURCE, Task Forces are ad hoc committees of a few consultants who spend a couple weeks working to improve our internal functioning or help a nonprofit we are not partnered with. Rachel was leading one to expand the internal SOURCE Marketing Kit by designing a new, more comprehensive resource. I signed up right away. With a desire to impact the internal operations of SOURCE, I was excited to contribute. However, I hit that sign up almost instantly for the opportunity to use InDesign, something I knew basically nothing about. This was my chance to do what I had such a hard time doing: asking for those “teaching moments.”</p>
    <p>After developing content for a few weeks, Rachel scheduled several design sessions for us to work together on the final product in InDesign. I, cautiously eager, signed up for all of them. At the first session, Rachel gave a quick tour around the program before offering up the “design chair” and stepping aside. Surprised, those of us there looked at each other nervously before taking turns creating the first page of content.</p>
    <p>Leaving the first session, I told Rachel that I was really interested in learning InDesign. She immediately pulled out her schedule and picked some times for me to come help her design. Excited, but worried about overstepping, I could not believe that she was so willing to spend extra time to help me learn.</p>
    <p>I began feeling more comfortable asking Rachel to meet for more design sessions, and we spent hours working on the project beyond the original sessions. By the third group meeting, I was teaching the other consultants about InDesign tools and tricks. As we finished the final product, I was proud of the work we had done and felt comfortable navigating InDesign.</p>
    <p>I showed up to the first session never having seen InDesign. More importantly, I showed up to that first session nervous to ask others to spend extra time to teach me. Not only did I create and shape a project that I know will help SOURCE consultants moving forward, I learned how to ask for a teacher, the opportunity to grow, and the time to learn.</p>
    <p>In Rachel’s TaskForce, I realized that what I first thought to be intimidating is an incredible gift. SOURCE is not strong just because it has consultants with so many different areas of knowledge, but because it is also an organization that facilitates opportunities for us to learn from each other and encourages us to just ask for a chance.</p>
