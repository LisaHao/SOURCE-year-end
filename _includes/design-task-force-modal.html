    <p>I dragged one last text box into place. Overwhelmed with anticipation, I quickly typed the final few words before scrolling to the title page. The new Marketing Kit for incoming SOURCE Consultants was complete. I scanned each page, thrilled to see the complex structure and intricate design schemes we had woven together. I was proud that I had helped design these pages and amazed to think I had first worked with InDesign only weeks before. Finishing the kit marked more than the end of a project—it was a pivotal moment in my SOURCE experience that transformed my view on team development.</p>
    <p>At the start of the semester, Rachel Alaynick created a task force to design a resource on best practices and branding guidelines. I did not know InDesign, but it had been at the top of my wish list for some time and that drew me in. There were already enough consultants signed up, but I added my name to the list, figuring I could watch the more experienced team members to learn the basics.</p>
    <p>Up until this year, my leadership and technical skills came about in a pretty specific way. I would describe it as a “we do, you watch” model. In the organizations I had worked with in the past, work opportunities went to those with the most experience, so gaining proficiency in uncharted waters was limited almost exclusively to what I could garner from observation. At the end of the day, a finished project always took priority over a teachable moment. Value put on personal development and skill-building was just not part of any cultures I had come to know.</p>
    <p>Naturally, this learning style came with me when I joined SOURCE. I stepped up when I had skills to offer, and I stepped back to learn from the sidelines when I did not. I was not in the habit of asking others to take time away from product-driven tasks to teach me, so I rarely got to try my hand at new endeavors. With a few experienced InDesign users on the task force, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn some of the software without jeopardizing the project’s progress.</p>
    <p>After a few weeks dedicated to content aggregation, Rachel scheduled several group design sessions. I signed up for all of them. At the first session, Rachel gave a quick tour around the program before offering up the “design chair.” She was clear; we were learning first and designing second. This was a surprise. Though hesitant at first, I remember feeling privileged to take my turn at creating the first page of content.</p>
    <p>When I confided in Rachel that I was determined to learn InDesign, she pulled out her schedule and offered some additional time without hesitation. My initiative was met by her dedication to facilitating hands-on learning as part of the team-building process. Rachel invested hours outside the original sessions walking me through the software. By the third group meeting, I found myself showing other consultants tools and tricks. When I finally dragged that last text box into place, I felt comfortable navigating InDesign.</p>
    <p>We spent a few weeks designing the final product, something that would have taken Rachel only a weekend to finish. Not only did I help shape a project that I know will support SOURCE consultants moving forward, but I also gained a valuable skill and the desire to pass it along to others in the organization. While “we do, you watch” might seem best in the moment, especially when there is pressure to meet deadlines, SOURCE knows this model is short-sighted. Yes, SOURCE has consultants who are are experts in many areas, but it is the prioritization of our team development and commitment to invest time and resources into individual growth that really sets it apart. It was while working on this task force that I realized that my development in SOURCE is not simply a byproduct of our client work or internal initiatives, it is by design.</p>
