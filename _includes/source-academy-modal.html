    <p>This year, SOURCEâ€™s marketing team proudly launched SOURCE Academy: an innovative YouTube channel that uses animated videos to address the most common issues that nonprofits encounter.</p>
    <p>Here at SOURCE, our passion comes from both our belief in the power of nonprofits and our belief in our ability to help nonprofits fulfill their missions. Unfortunately, SOURCE has a limited client capacity. SOURCE can only manage seven intensive nonprofit relationships per year. As SOURCE has grown, we realized that we have the ability and passion to expand our outreach in other ways. SOURCE has three effective avenues of outreach: IdeaJams, Nonprofit Lunch & Learns, and Task Forces. As powerful as these three methods have been, they are still limited to nonprofits located in the Greater Claremont area. By harnessing the power of YouTube, SOURCE Academy allows us to share our strategies remotely and expand our services to the thousands of nonprofits that work to improve communities across the United States.</p>

    <p>SOURCE realized that many nonprofits face similar, if not exactly the same, issues. Based on our 13 years of consulting experience, we compiled a list of issues that nonprofits encounter most often. Some of these issues fall under topics like volunteer recruitment, donor retention, and social media improvement. Led by SOURCE consultant Kenlyn Mirbach, our marketing team created SOURCE Academy to cover these topics. Each video explains general strategies that nonprofits can apply and adapt to their own situations in order to address these issues. We trust that nonprofits will benefit from these best practices because they have been implemented, improved and tested in numerous situations over the course of our 13 years of nonprofit consulting.</p>
    <p>SOURCE Academy is a promising step towards increasing SOURCE's outreach. However, it also serves as an exciting new opportunity for our consultants to do what they do best: think creatively. Creating SOURCE Academy videos has been an enriching experience for SOURCE consultants. Consultants get to explore and learn an exciting animation design software, write scripts, and storyboard videos to make each video as engaging as possible. The video design process prompts consultants to think of creative ways to compile their extensive consulting knowledge into a two-minute video, while conveying those ideas visually. SOURCE Academy has ultimately introduced consultants to aspects of product management by teaching them about product scheduling, product design, and product delivery.</p>
    <p>We are excited to see how nonprofits receive SOURCE Academy and we are looking forward to developing effective ways to market the channel. Most of all, we at SOURCE are proud to say that we are able to help more nonprofits fulfill their missions.</p>
