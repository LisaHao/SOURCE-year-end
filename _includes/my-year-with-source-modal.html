    <p>That familiar sinking feeling in my stomach was back: it was nearing the end of the IdeaJam, and I had written down several ideas for the issues that this nonprofit had brought up, but the conversation was moving so quickly that I had not figured out a way to jump in. This kind of moment occurred pretty often. I was so in awe of the creativity, professionalism, and work ethic of all of my fellow consultants that I viewed myself as unable to ever reach their level. As a result, I would only speak up whenever there was a lull in the conversation. I wanted to contribute, but everyone else seemed much more confident in their ideas, so I felt out of place and did not want to take up too much space in the discussion.</p>
    <p>Thankfully, near the end of the meeting, Lili noticed that I was struggling to speak up and invited me into the conversation. Afterward, she told me that I had good ideas and encouraged me to feel more confident jumping in with them, sharing that she related to my struggles with self-doubt. I was blown away — she was so talented and seemed so sure of herself! — but of course, she struggled with confidence too. It was a revelatory moment; I had been assuming everyone knew what they were doing and that I was the only one who felt so unsure, but everyone deals with uncertainty. I realized that professionalism and the ability to project confidence were skills that could be practiced, not innate traits people were born with.</p>
    <p>My mindset started to shift. I did not need to become another person to successfully help clients and grow. Instead, I could, and should, draw on my own unique traits and skills, even the ones that did not seem professional or relevant to consulting. For example, I might not know how to make an inventory tool, but I love to draw. In a client meeting where we were discussing logo designs, my lead noticed me drawing the design ideas in my notebook and asked me to show them to the client, and I ended up learning how to use graphic design editors and making the final logo. Our strengths fit together like puzzle pieces to make a successful project. I contributed and grew by being myself.</p>
    <p>Meetings slowly became easier, as speaking up was no longer a daunting task but a goal to practice. So I practiced, and in my next IdeaJam I jumped in more easily and spoke more often. I asked team members if I could work on deliverables with them to expose myself to new skills. Growth came much faster when I built on my existing strengths instead of trying to become some narrow view of what I thought consultants were supposed to be like. Moreover, I came to understand teams were stronger with a diversity of backgrounds, skills, and ideas; if everyone were the same, there would be less room for creativity and pushback. Not only was it possible for me to be a contributing team member by being myself, but I would actually be a better team member by doing so. Even my uncertainty and doubt, previously the source of so much self-criticism, helped me reflect on my ideas and make sure everyone in the conversation was heard. There is no single right way to be a consultant, and our variation is an asset.</p>
    <p>Besides improving my client work, these lessons helped me become a better Digital Lead as I learned to trust my leadership abilities. Although I’m still working on trusting myself, I’ve learned to apply my newfound confidence to my life outside SOURCE by participating in debate competitions and applying for positions such as First Year Guide. I cannot wait to welcome the upcoming AC cohort, and know that each of them will bring invaluable skills to the SOURCE team. I hope that they learn to recognize those strengths in themselves as well.</p>
